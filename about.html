<center><p style="color:darkred">A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one.<br>
 A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university,<br>
 an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.<br>

In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution<br>
 that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without<br>
 its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United States, a college may offer<br>
 undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be <br>
 a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions <br>
 that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.<br>
 [1] The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US.<br>
 [2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.</p></center>
